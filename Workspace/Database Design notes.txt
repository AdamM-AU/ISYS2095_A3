* Understanding the Data *

From looking at the data "Locations.csv" is the most important data to start with. Why? this is our glue keeping it altogether (Primary Key)

[locations.csv]

--> [Table] Locations
	- iso_code [PK] (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 â€“ three-letter country codes)
	- location (name of the country (or region within a country))

--> [Table] LocationVaccinces
	- iso_code 
	- vaccine_id (vaccine administered in the country up to the current date)
	- date_avaliable (When did the country first use this vaccine
	- date_unavliable (when did this become unavliable to the country)
	- data_source (unique id of the data source listed in Table --> DataSource) (Data source used for this country)
	
	select * from Vaccines where iso_code="AUS"  will return a row for each vaccine used in australia
	
--> Vaccines
	- vaccine_id
	- vaccine
	
--> [Table] DataSource
	- source_id (unique, auto-incremented)
	- iso_code
	- source_name
	- source_website
	- last_observation
	
[vaccinations.csv]
All tables using "location" to link counties data will be replaced with "iso_code" select iso_code from Locations where location=<location>)
* in this case we are simply ignoring the location column during import

--> [Table] CountryVaccinations
	- iso_code 
	- date
	- total_vaccinations
	- people_vaccinated
	- people_fully_vaccinated
	- daily_vaccinations_raw
	- daily_vaccinations
	- total_vaccinations_per_hundred
	- people_vaccinated_per_hundred
	- people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred
	- daily_vaccinations_per_million

[vaccinations-by-age-group.csv]
* Use "location" column to find "iso_code" drop "location" column
* So we dont need to store as much data lets put the age groups into another table and simply reference them.

--> AgeGroups
	- age_group_id
	- group
	
	[DATA] 18-24, 25-49, 50-59,	60-69, 70-79, 80+

--> AgeGroupVaccinations
	- iso_code
	- date
	- age_group_id
	- people_vaccinated_perhundred
	- people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred
	
[vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv]
* Use "location" column to find "iso_code" drop "location" column

--> CountryVaccByManufacturer
	- iso_code
	- date
	- vaccine_id
	- total_vaccinations

[us_state_vaccinations.csv]
* location remains as this is a the state
* add iso_code for future use maybe we will have australian states?

--> CountryStateDailyTotals
	- iso_code
	- location
	- date
	- total_vaccinations
	- total_distributed
	- people_vaccinated	
	- people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred
	- total_vaccinations_per_hundred 
	- people_fully_vaccinated
	- people_vaccinated_per_hundred
	- distributed_per_hundred
	- daily_vaccinations_raw
	- daily_vaccinations
	- daily_vaccinations_per_million
	- share_doses_used	

[locations/<country>.csv]
* Use "location" column to find "iso_code" drop "location" column

--> CountryDailyTotals
	- iso_code
	- date
	- vaccine_id (this isnt needed as we track when the country had this avaliable in the "LocationVaccinces" table
	- source_id
	- total_vaccinations
	- people_vaccinated
	- people_fully_vaccinated
